TO DO:
  - Fix number positioning when number of digits > 1
    - Hint column needs an incrementing offset
    - Hint row just needs centering
  - Add a lil watermark
  - Pass in function parameters as command line arguments
    - Maybe make two versions, one for user and one for testing
  - Add support for black and white, or even color images (not necessarily BMP)
  - Add a list of required modules, and make it easy for people to use it
